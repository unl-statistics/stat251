## Feedback

- Graded: homework 11 (functions - really: *lists*)

- Today: last edits for scripts

- Thursday: submit your screencast 

  [adding timestamps as chapters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiMoSDztAhw)
  
  no required attendance in class on Thursday (May 1)


## Script


For each of the Things you defined, write out at least three paragraphs:

Make sure to:

  - include  definitions (i.e. how do you measure strength) 
  - give context (i.e. which variables are used)
  - tie 'things' in with the topics in the class


## Functions and List

are the extension of vector calculus

```{r echo = TRUE}
(x <- sample(1:10, 15, replace = TRUE))
(y <- sample(1:10, 15, replace = TRUE))
```

Add the first element in `x` to the first element in `y`: 
```{r echo=TRUE} 
x[1] + y[1]
```

Now do that for all elements in `x` and `y`:

```{r echo = TRUE}
x + y
```

```{r echo = TRUE}
1:length(x) |> lapply(FUN = function(i) x[i] + y[i]) |> unlist()
```

```{python echo = TRUE}
sum_xy = map(lambda i: r.x[i]+r.y[i], range(1,len(r.x)))
list(sum_xy)
```

## Your Turn: Graphs of functions

Plot the graph of the function for $\alpha = \beta = 1/2$ on the interval [0,1]:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} x^{\alpha -1} (1 - x)^{\beta - 1}
$$
$B(\alpha, \beta)$ is the beta function - a generalization of the (inverse) binomial coefficient. 
Implemented as `beta(a, b)` in R, in python use `math.gamma` and the relationship to the Gamma function $\Gamma$:

$$
B(a, b) = \frac{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a + b)}
$$

## Your Turn: Multiple Graphs

Now make $\alpha$ a vector `alpha` and plot graphs for values of $\alpha \in \{ 0.5, 0.6, ..., 1.2\}$

... can you vectorize $\beta$ similarly?
