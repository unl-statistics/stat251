# Introductions

## Introduce yourself!

- Name / Year / Major

- What do you hope to learn in this class?

- Previous computing experience?

- Is a poptart a ravioli? Why or why not?

## My Introduction

- Professor in Statistics 

- At UNL since August, I was at ISU for 20 years

- first computer language was Pascal :) 

- R user since 1996, Python user (? I have learned it four times by now)


## On PopTarts and Ravioli:

## Academic Integrity Policy {.r-fit-text}

- You may (should!) work with each other on homework assignments

- Work alone on exams

- You must be able to explain anything you submit    
[At my discretion, I can use a one-on-one discussion of your work to replace the grade for that work.]{.smaller}

- ChatGPT, StackOverflow, Google are tools, but they do not help you think
