## Logistics 

- [Reading quiz 9](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-wrangling/06-data-join.html) due 


- Focus on homework 8 on Tuesday, start working on homework 9 on Thursday

- Start thinking about the [project](https://unl-statistics.github.io/stat251/project/)

## Reshaping {background-image="../figs/the-key.png" background-size="400px" background-position="right 10% bottom 45%"}

      
Is the data tidy? - question of the key

- the key

- the whole key

- and nothing but the key

## The key - First normal form {background-image="../figs/the-key.png" background-size="400px" background-position="right 10% bottom 5%"}

A data set can be written in a rectangular form: 

- each observation is in one row

- each variable is in a column

- there is a key: one or more variables in the dataset provide a unique descriptor for each observation


## Not in First Normal Form 

Example 1: no key

```{r}
runif(10)
```


Example 2: not rectangular

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figs/violate-nf1-example.png")
```

## The whole key - 2nd normal form {background-image="../figs/the-key.png" background-size="400px" background-position="right 10% bottom 5%"}

A table is in 2nd normal form, when:

- it is in 1st normal form 

- and all non-key columns depend on all parts of the key 

"No split key"


Tables in 1st normal form with a single key variable are automatically in 2nd normal form

## Is this table in 2nd normal form?

![](../figs/courses_table3.webp)


## Nothing but the key - 3rd normal form {background-image="../figs/the-key.png" background-size="400px" background-position="right 10% bottom 5%"}

A table is in 3rd normal form, when:

- it is in 2nd normal form 

- and no non-key column can be determined by another non-key column

e.g.: zip code determines county and state

## Data Normalization

Process of getting table into higher normal forms is called *normalization*

Normalization gives a framework to organize and ensure

- reduce redundancy in data
- improve data consistency
- simplify the database design
- increase speed to access data
- easier maintenance

Normalization is generally terrible for any statistical modelling

## Key-Value Pairs

Stricter version of the 3rd NF: 

- table is in 2nd normal form, 
- there is only a single non-key element in a table

Note: a table like this is automatically in 3rd normal form. 

## Traits of Dog Breeds

```{r}
traits <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-02-01/breed_traits.csv")
head(traits)
```

Data set is in "Wide Form"


Without knowing the data well, it could be that some of the non-key variables could determine parts of other  non-key variables (violations of 3rd normal form)

## Traits of Dog Breeds in Long Form

```{r echo = TRUE}
traits %>% select(Breed, 2:4) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:4, names_to = "Trait", values_to = "Score") %>% 
  head()
```

The combination of `Breed` and `Trait` (Key) uniquely determines the score value (Value).


## Homework 8 


- Reshape two data sets
- Create a visual in each
- One reshaping in python, one in R

## Visuals in homework 8


```{r out.width='90%'}
#| label: fig-homework8
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-cap: 
#|   - Trait Distributions
#|   - Ranks of (some) Breeds over time
knitr::include_graphics("../figs/breeds-traits.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../figs/rank-breeds.png")
```
