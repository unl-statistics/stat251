## Last Class

- Started working on Homework #2
  
- If you made at least one submission to github, you have some points for homework #2 in Canvas

# Algorithmic thinking

- Computer take things literally

- Every step needs to be explained

- e.g. [Making of a PBJ sandwich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN2RM-CHkuI&pp=ugUEEgJlbg%3D%3D)

# A palindrome is ...

- "an expression that reads the same forwards and backwards"

::: {.fragment}

- "Taco Cat" is not equal to "taC ocaT"
:::

::: {.fragment}
- ignore letter casing (`tolower`, `str_to_lower`)
:::

::: {.fragment}
- "taco cat" is still not equal to "tac ocat"
:::

::: {.fragment}
- ignore spaces and punctuation (`stri_replace`)
:::

::: {.fragment}
- "tacocat" is equal to "tacocat"!
:::

# Useful functions and packages

- packages/libraries 

    - in R: `stringr`, `stringi`
    - in python: `re`


- functions

    - in R: `tolower`, `stri_reverse`, `stri_sub_all`
    - in python: `.lower()`, `[::-1]`, `re.sub`

  
# Today's goal

- make at least one submission to Github 

- Review function writing: [section 13](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-gen-prog/05-functions.html)

# What Chatgbt thinks palindromes are ...

# 

> Create some palindromes with topics from the R tidyverse

ChatGPT said:

Sure, I can get creative with that! Here are some palindromes inspired by the R tidyverse package:

ggplot palindrome:

"plot, ggplot, ggplot, top, lg"

dplyr palindrome:

"pipe, dep, ed, epip"


tidyr palindrome:

"tidy, rid, id, ydit"

stringr palindrome:

"strings, r, r, sgnirts"
tibble palindrome:

# 

> The first one is not a palindrome

ChatGPT said:

You’re absolutely right! My bad on that one. A palindrome needs to read the same backward and forward. Let me fix that for you! Here's a proper one:

For ggplot:

"ggplot, tol, log, gg"

That works better as a true palindrome. Thanks for catching that! Would you like more examples, or should I tweak any of the others?

# From a block of code to functions

When you execute the same code multiple times, you should wrap the code into a function:

# Code block to function

![](fig/palindrome-function.png)

# Function definitions

# As an extra challenge ... (for extra credit)

Can you establish how fast your function `palindrome` is?

[Measuring speed in R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/05/5-ways-to-measure-running-time-of-r-code/)

[Measuring speed in python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html#module-timeit)

Which is faster? R or python? - You might have to make multiple calls to the functions to capture differences



# Dos and Don'ts 

There are some things we should not (ever) do in R Markdown (or quarto) documents:

- Install a package 

- Print a full data set

- "Step on no p-values"

...




# Next Time

- Review 

  - indexing, 
  - data frames/structures, 
  - thinking in column/row-shaped objects
