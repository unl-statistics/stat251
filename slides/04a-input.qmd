# Homework 3

- Solutions look good (feedback on anything you pushed to github)

- Mini stumble block: the punctuation vector

```
punctuation <- c(".", ",", "!", "?", "'", """, "(", ")", " ", "-", ";", ":")
```
Do not just delete the `"""` 

instead use single quotes `'"'` or backslash `"\""`



# Topics to Know

- Types of data formats    
(raw text, binary file, spreadsheet, database, non-tabular data)
- How to read in raw text files (fixed width vs. delimited)
- How to read in spreadsheets
- Recognize binary files (e.g. Rdata or RDS)
