# Exploratory Data Analysis

- For observed data (rather than a study), a (descriptive) data exploration is often the only thing we can do

- But with any new data set, you should do some initial exploration: what are the assumptions (what have you been told about the data?) - are implied expectations holding up?
  
- Make sure to read through the [EDA chapter](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-wrangling/02a-eda.html) 


# In-class exercise

During an unusual episode, a number of people were exposed and some died. 
You are asked to determine the nature of the unusual episode by asking **data-motivated** yes/no questions 

You will see two tables: 

  - deaths by economic status and sex

  - deaths by economic status and age

# What would you expect?

Before seeing the data 

- what are your expectations regarding *exposure* by economic status, by sex, and by age?

- what are your expectations regarding *death numbers/rates* by economic status, by sex, and by age?

Now we look at the data: What anomalies do you notice?

# Homework - Reading Data with Cookies

- Work on homework #4: what are your expectations regarding the data?

- One way of asking questions, is to re-phrase an expectation in form of '(how) does the data deviate from ...?'

- Generally, when the data does not meet expectations, we find weird stuff ...
