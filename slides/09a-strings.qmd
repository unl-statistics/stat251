Split data into multiple columns | ![](fig/split-cols.svg){fig-alt="A column consisting of multiple rows of three boxes. An arrow indicates a transition from the single column to multiple columns, each containing only one type of box."}
Join data into a single column | ![](fig/join-cols.svg){fig-alt="A set of three columns, each containing one type of box. An arrow indicates a transition whereby in each row, the three columns of data are combined into a single column."}
