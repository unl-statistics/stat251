# Where we are

Plan for Thursdays: 

  - if there are questions on the current homework assignment, work on that, 
  - start on the new assignment

Are there more questions for the Graphics homework? 

# 

... next chapter


# Computing with data

- data is the central object: 

    what is `data`?

- every action we do, takes a data set as an argument and returns a (modified) data set

```
data in -> action -> data out
```

# ... then ...

- the pipe (in R): 

pipe operator `%>%` or `|>` let's us string these actions together

```
data_in %>% action1 %>% action2 %>% action3 -> data_out
```

- the parenthesis `(` dot approach `.` `)` (in python)

```
data_out = ( data_in.action1.action2.action3.
  action4 ) 
```


Read as 'then'

# Data Actions

small number of actions that work together (think old-timey LEGO, not play mobile)

  - get a subset of the rows 
  - get a subset of the columns 
  - transform/add variables
  - calculate numeric summaries
    
  - introduce special groupings


# Data Actions (in R)

small number of actions that work together (think old-timey LEGO, not play mobile)

  - get a subset of the rows: `filter`
  - get a subset of the columns: `select` 
  - transform/add variables: `mutate`
  - calculate numeric summaries: `summarize`
    
  - introduce special groupings: `group_by`

# Data Actions (in python)

small number of actions that work together (think old-timey LEGO, not play mobile)

  - get a subset of the rows: `query` 
  - get a subset of the columns: select by name or index
  - transform/add variables: `assign`
  - calculate numeric summaries: `describe`
    
  - introduce special groupings: `groupby` (and `agg` or `expanding`)

# Grouping

Grouping acts as a multiplier for each of the other actions

Grouping by (usually categorical) variable(s) allows us to apply all of the other actions more specifically to each (combination of the) level(s) of variable(s) 

 

Example (`summarize`):

summary across a whole dataset

    find the average height 

becomes group specific

    find the average height for men and women (group by gender)
    find the average height by sport  (group by athletic discipline)
    find the average height by sport and sex
    

# Grouping

Grouping by (usually categorical) variable(s) is syntactic glue that allows us to apply all of the other actions more specifically

  
  

Example (`filter`):

filter across a whole dataset

    find the top earner

becomes group specific

    find the top earner among men and women 
    find the top earner in each athletic discipline
    find the top earner among men and women in each athletic discipline

# Next time

- Continue working on homework assignment

- Start of (take-home) midterm week

- Prep with the [practice exam](https://unl-statistics.github.io/stat251/exam/2023-midterm/), look over the [covered topics](https://unl-statistics.github.io/stat251/exam/2023-midterm/objectives.html)
