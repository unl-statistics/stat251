# Survey Results

- **What is helping me to learn in this class?**

textbook for reading quiz

trouble-shooting in class 

work time in class

examples in class

talking with classmates


#

- **What am I doing to improve my learning in the course?**

ask questions

starting homework early, think about it during the week

look things up: textbook, resources outside the class (videos, other articles)

check homework before class to see if there are immediate questions


# 
- **What changes are needed in this course to improve learning?**

More clarity - 

  How does homework tie in with requirements?
  
  clearer materials

Sample solution for homework 


#
- **What do I need to do to improve my learning in this course?**

Ask more questions

Practice coding

Do readings earlier, try to absorb more information from readings

Be more present in class/pay better attention


# Some Logistics

Homework #5 due date: Thursday night (11:59 pm)

All subsequent due-dates for homework assignments will be Thursday night

Keep due-dates for readings and quizzes on Tuesday

Plan for Thursdays: 
  - if there are questions on the current homework assignment, work on that, 
  - start on the new assignment


# Homework: Graphics

- How does the homework tie to the readings? 

- Working on skills: how to make graphics

- Work on concepts: what are mappings, and how do they effect the conclusions

- Work on presentation: what are more effective ways of presenting information


# Homework rubric

![](fig/graphics-groundhogs-rubric.png){fig-alt="Rubric for homework assignment. Data exploration is worth 2 points, and includes each variable explored and each plot described with 1-2 sentences. Grammar of graphics - probabilities and grammar of graphics - agreement are worth 1.5 points each. Ugly chart in R is worth 2.5 points, including the explanation of why the chart is ugly. Ugly chart in python is worth 2.5 points, including the explanation of why the chart is ugly."}



# Graphics week homework

- Part I: Make visual summaries for two new data sets and think about mappings

- Part II: Use your knowledge to create the worst!


# Data Exploration

Make charts for all variables that are listed by name:

`groundhogs.csv`

  - lat, long
  - country
  - isGroundhog
  - active
  - predictionsCount

`predictions.csv`

  - isGroundhog
  - year
  - shadow


# Variable `active`

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
groundhogs <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stat-assignments/eda-groundhogs/97ab0e01b64aa3a1749247983a9b05a0c30b5c0c/groundhogs.csv")
groundhogs %>% ggplot(aes(x = active)) + geom_bar()
```
This is a barchart of the variable `active`, the variable is mapped to the x axis,  the count for each bar (corresponding to the height of the bars) is mapped to y. Finding: Very few (`r sum(groundhogs$active==0)`) groundhogs are not active. 

# Probabilities and Agreement

Answer the following two questions using charts. Explain your chart, and explain how it answers the question.

**Do different groundhogs have different probabilities of predicting 6 more weeks of winter?**

**How much do North American groundhogs tend to agree on their predictions?**

# 

Do different groundhogs have different probabilities of predicting 6 more weeks of winter?



```{r echo = TRUE}
predictions <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stat-assignments/eda-groundhogs/refs/heads/main/groundhog-predictions.csv")

predictions %>% 
  mutate(name = reorder(factor(name), name, length)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = name)) + geom_bar() +
  geom_bar(aes( weight = shadow), fill = "darkorange") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) + 
  ggtitle("Number of predictions\nNumber of times seeing a shadow in orange")

```

What about missing values in the shadow variable?

#

How do we need to change the previous chart?

```{r echo = TRUE}
predictions <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stat-assignments/eda-groundhogs/refs/heads/main/groundhog-predictions.csv")

predictions %>% 
  filter(!is.na(shadow)) %>%
  mutate(name = reorder(factor(name), name, length)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = name)) + geom_bar(aes(fill=factor(shadow)), position = "fill") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) 

```
limitations: different groundhogs have made very different number of predictions (and for different years)

#
How much do North American groundhogs tend to agree on their predictions?

```{r}
predictions %>% 
  filter(!is.na(shadow), year > 2009) %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = year, fill = factor(shadow))) + geom_bar(position="fill")
```

# 
For years since 2010 ... in each year close to 50/50 shadow/noshadow prediction - that's the least amount of agreement we can possibly get!

```{r}
predictions %>% 
  filter(!is.na(shadow), year > 2009) %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = year, fill = factor(shadow))) + geom_bar(position="fill")
```

# 
But ... when we color points by prediction, there seems to be regional agreement

```{r}
predictions %>% 
  filter(!is.na(shadow), year > 2011) %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = long, y = lat, colour = factor(shadow))) + geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~year)
```
Is this perceived agreement real?

#
Which plot shows the most geographic agreement?
```{r fig.width=12, fig.height = 8}
library(nullabor)
sample_year <- sample(2011:2023, 1)
data <- predictions %>% filter(year == sample_year, !is.na(shadow)) %>%
  mutate(shadow = factor(shadow))

pos <- sample(16, 1)
lineup(null_permute('shadow'), data, pos = pos) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, colour = shadow)) + 
  geom_point() + facet_wrap(~.sample) + 
  theme_bw()

```

# 

year was `r sample_year`
data is in `r pos`

... maybe there is not even regional geographic agreement between the predictions.

Lineups help us to calibrate our eyes and distinguish random patterns from real visual findings.
