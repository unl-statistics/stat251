# Homework 3

- graded with feedback

- almost done :)


# Vector to matrices 

default in R is to fill columns first

```{r echo = TRUE}
x <- 1:9
matrix(x, ncol=3)
```

# Vector to matrices 

in python rows are filled first! `order="F"` changes that:

```{python echo=TRUE}
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(1, 10)
matrix_x = x.reshape(-1, 3)
print(matrix_x)

matrix_x = x.reshape(-1, 3, order="F")
print(matrix_x)

```
# Indices

The 18th element in a vector in R has index 18.

The 18th element in a vector in python has index 17 - same with columns! You need to keep that difference in mind

# Extra Credit

LLMs have a bad rep for creating meh text and fabulating on facts.

What they are (usually) great for, are translations from one programming language to another.

For extra credit: 

Take your code from your preferred language, and let an LLM translate it for you into the other language. Provide the code and describe your experience.
