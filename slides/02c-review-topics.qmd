## Last Class

- If you made at least one submission to github, you have some points for homework #2 in Canvas

# Today's goal


- Review function writing: [section 13](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-gen-prog/05-functions.html)


- Code chunks in quarto documents

# From a block of code to functions

When you execute the same code multiple times, you should wrap the code into a function:

# Code block to function

# Function definitions

# As an extra challenge ... (for extra credit)

Can you establish how fast your function `palindrome` is?

[Measuring speed in R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/05/5-ways-to-measure-running-time-of-r-code/)

[Measuring speed in python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html#module-timeit)

Which is faster? R or python? - You might have to make multiple calls to the functions to capture differences



# Dos and Don'ts 

There are some things we should not (ever) do in R Markdown (or quarto) documents:

- Install a package 

- Print a full data set


...




# Next Time

- Review for homework #3

  - indexing, 
  - data frames/structures, 
  - thinking in column/row-shaped objects
