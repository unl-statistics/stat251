## Logistics

## Feedback

- Screencasts all look good 

- Make sure to fill out the class survey!


- Peer Review is open:

  - make sure that you can access the github repo (you might have to send a comment) and the video
  - watch the video
  - read through the script
  - run the code
  - submit your feedback by Thursday next week

## Access to repo

- Go into Canvas
- Follow the link to the youtube video
- Follow the link to the repo - you most likely don't have access to the repo

  - leave your github handle in the comments of the two screencasts you are reviewing
  - go into your own screencast, get the github handles from your reviewers, add them as collaborators to your repo

## Add the screencast to your portfolio

- portfolios are important for getting internships/industry positions

- right now: 

  - final project is private  (because of FERPA)
  - no good way to make fork of private repo public (because of Github rules, protection of instructor's IP)
  

- best solution (right now): make a new repo (public or private), copy the necessary files, and link that to your portfolio

## Maps in R and python

- Last homework assignment - essentially attendance-based

- Work on some map-related question, submit by the end of class on Thursday for full credit


## Maps in R and python

Maps provide a lot of context

```{r echo=TRUE}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 42)

orcas <- tuesdata$orcas
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
orcas |> ggplot(aes(x = begin_longitude, y = end_latitude)) + geom_point()
```
## Orca Encounters

```{r echo = TRUE}
usmap <- map_data("state")
usmap |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat)) + 
  geom_path(aes(group = group)) + 
  geom_point(data = orcas, aes(x = begin_longitude, y = begin_latitude), colour = "darkorange")
```

## Closer Orca Encounters 

```{r echo = TRUE}
usmap |> dplyr::filter(region=="washington") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat)) + 
  geom_path(aes(group = group)) + 
  geom_point(data = orcas, aes(x = begin_longitude, y = begin_latitude), colour = "darkorange")
```
