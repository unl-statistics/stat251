# Homework 4

Where are you at?

# Graphics week! {.r-fit-text}

You should have read:

- [Graphics](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-wrangling/02b-graphics.html)
    - Focus on relationships between variables
    - Grammar of Graphics vs. Manual plot specification/mapping
    - Exploratory data analysis

- [Good Graphics](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-wrangling/02c-good-graphics.html)
    - Perception & Cognition
    - Use the least complicated chart that still works

# Make Graphics!

- Part I: Make visual summaries for two new data sets and think about mappings

- Part II: Use your knowledge to create the worst!


# Resources for this week

- [R](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) and [Python](https://python-graph-gallery.com/) Graph Galleries

- [Ugly Chart Challenge](https://stat850-at-unl.github.io/stat-850-08-graphics-graphics-ugly/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png) [variant](https://stat850-at-unl.github.io/stat-850-08-graphics-graphics-ugly/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-2.png) example from last semester's graduate class

- [Customizing ggplot2 plots](https://rdpeng.github.io/RProgDA/customizing-ggplot2-plots.html)
    - Also an RStudio addin package - `ggThemeAssist`
