There are tables with different pieces of information - social media checkins, people, drivers licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more. \n\nPick R or Python, and solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. \n\nYour solution must be reproducible -- that is, you should use dplyr verbs, table joins, etc. to solve the mystery, rather than just looking through the tables yourselves.\n\nYou may work in groups of 2-4 people on this assignment. Each person should turn in their own assignment, but should list their group members as authors.\n\nMake sure you do your due diligence! You should double check your answer and print out the guilty party's interview from the database.\n\n**For 5 bonus points, when you're finished in one language, write equivalent code in the other language to solve the problem.**\n\nWhen you are finished with the assignment: \n\n- Once you have finished this assignment, render the document (Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-K or the Render button). \n- Commit the qmd file and any other files you have changed to the repository and push your changes.\n- In Canvas, submit a link to your github repository containing the updated files.\n- Provide the name of the guilty party in the text input field on Canvas, and make sure all of your work is on GitHub to receive full credit.\n\nThe chunks below use the code to read in each of the 8 tables of data for this assignment.\n\nHints:\n\n- You can use a lot of filter statements, but it will in many cases be easier to use joins. \n- See if you can write code that doesn't require you to type out knowledge gained from a previous clue (e.g. pipe your results from one query into the next)\n\n\n***\n\nA crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on January 15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. All the clues to this mystery are buried in a huge database, and you need to use R and SAS to navigate through this network of information. Your first step to solving the mystery is to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report from the police department's database. \n\nThis database schema may help you figure out how to navigate the database:\n\n![sql-murder-mystery database schema diagram](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries/blob/master/schema.png?raw=true)\n\n## R\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(RSQLite)\nlibrary(DBI)\n\n# Your database connection code goes here.
