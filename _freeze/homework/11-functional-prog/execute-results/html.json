Decide whether to use R or Python for dogs or cats. You must use one language for one animal and the other language for the other animal. Fill in the markdown headers below accordingly.\n\n1. Read in the JSON file.\n\n2. Assemble a data frame with the animal's name, age, sex, breed(s), and organization ID.\n\n3. Add a column to your data frame with a list of picture links    \n(Hint: use list columns)\n\n4. (Bonus) Find some way to generate a collage or gif of pictures of the animals up for adoption right now.\n\n# Solutions\n## R - Animal (change this to match)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Python - Animal (change this to match)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n",
