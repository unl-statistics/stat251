To do this, they assemble reliable data about a variety of global variables to help educate the general public.\n\nI have collected data from Gapminder about several variables: \n\n- Population\n- GDP Per Capita (inflation-adjusted US dollars)\n- Mean Household Income\n- CO2 emissions (tonnes per capita)\n- Energy Use (Kg of Oil-equivalent per capita)\n\nUse the data manipulation tools you've learned about to answer each of the following questions, which I've grouped into several general topics. Some questions may specify a specific language to use; if no language is specified, you may choose whether to use R or python to answer the question.\n\n## Read In the Data\n\nRead in the data in R and Python. In both languages, store the table in the variable `gapminder`. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Data Exploration\n\n### Missingness\n\nGapminder puts a lot of effort into curating certain variables; other variables are less frequently used (or are harder to assemble from reliable sources). \n\n#### CO2\nCreate a table of all countries with at least 30 observations of the CO2 variable. Your table should be called `co2_sum` and should have columns `country` and `n_obs`. Do not print out the table; instead, if you have done everything correctly, when your document is compiled the correct number of countries will be filled in in the sentence below the code chunk.\n\n<!-- Use R -->\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nco2_sum <- data.frame() # This is a blank data frame so that the lines below \n                        # work before you've filled your code in.\n                        # You can write your code below this line, or remove \n                        # these lines, whichever you prefer.\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are 0 countries with at least 30 years of CO2 data. On average, countries have NA years of data.\n\n#### Energy\n\nFor each country with defined energy data for at least 10 years, summarize the data by computing the following:\n\n\n\n- year of minimum energy consumption per capita\n- year of maximum energy consumption per capita\n- average rate of energy consumption change from min to max.    \nA rough estimate might be something like (max consumption - min consumption)/(max year - min year). This may not include the most recent data; that is ok.\n\nYour summary data frame, `energy_sum` should have one row for each country, with columns `yearmin`, `yearmax`, and `avgincrease`.\n\nAnswer in Python\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Income\n\nLocate the country which has had the biggest growth in income between 1980 and 2019. Create a simple line graph or scatter plot showing the income in this country (and only this country) over time.\n\n#### GDP\n\nLocate the country which had the biggest decrease (or smallest increase, if there are no decreases) in GDP between 1990 and 2022. Include only countries with at least 5 years of reported data between 1990 and 2022. Create a simple line graph or scatter plot showing the GDP in this country for all years which this information is provided.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nrm ./gapminder_data.csv\n```\n:::\n\n",
