Some examples include:\n\ndata cleaning (dplyr) verbs\nreshaping data (tidyr)\nworking with dates and times (lubridate)\nworking with strings (stringr)\nwriting functions to modularize your code\nvisualizing your data effectively\n\n\nUnlike David Robinson’s screencasts, you will write a rough pseudocode “script” before you start recording. This will give you a rough outline of how to do the analysis and what things you intend to cover.\nYour goal is to help a future Stat 251 student understand some of the topics covered in this class. So while David Robinson and others who record their screencasts live might not fully explain what he’s doing, you should take the time to explain each technique you decide to use in a way that will help someone else understand.\nThere will be three deliverables for this project:\n\nPlan your dataset and topics\nPseudocode script uploaded to github repository\nScreencast + github repository\n\nScreencast uploaded to YouTube/YuJa\nApproximate time index provided for each of the 4 techniques you’re demonstrating (examples)\nCode uploaded to github repository\n\n\nIn lieu of the final exam, you will peer review two classmates’ screencasts."

    "text": "Git and GitHub\nGit is a distributed Version Control System (VCS), which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you’ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. It also makes working with others easier—groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!\nGitHub is a way to use the same power of Git all online with an easy-to-use interface. It’s used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects.\nGitHub is home to some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you’re visualizing data or building a new game, there’s a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics of GitHub, but we’ll dig into the rest later."

    "section": "Understanding the GitHub flow",
    "text": "Understanding the GitHub flow\nThe GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment and collaborate on your projects easily, without the risk of losing your previous work.\n\nRepositories\nA repository is where your project work happens–think of it as your project folder. It contains all of your project’s files and revision history. You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files.\n\n\nCloning\nWhen a repository is created with GitHub, it’s stored remotely in the ☁️. You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two. This makes it easier to fix issues, add or remove files, and push larger commits. You can also use the editing tool of your choice as opposed to the GitHub UI. Cloning a repository also pulls down all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project! This can be helpful if you experiment with your project and then realize you liked a previous version more. To learn more about cloning, read “Cloning a Repository”.\n\n\nCommitting and pushing\nCommitting and pushing are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub. That way your instructor and/or teammates can see your latest work when you’re ready to share it. You can make a commit when you have made changes to your project that you want to “checkpoint.” You can also add a helpful commit message to remind yourself or your teammates what work you did (e.g. “Added a README with information about our project”).\nOnce you have a commit or multiple commits that you’re ready to add to your repository, you can use the push command to add those changes to your remote repository. Committing and pushing may feel new at first, but we promise you’ll get used to it 🙂"

    "section": "💻 GitHub terms to know",
    "text": "💻 GitHub terms to know\n\nRepositories\nWe mentioned repositories already, they are where your project work happens, but let’s talk a bit more about the details of them! As you work more on GitHub you will have many repositories which may feel confusing at first. Fortunately, your “GitHub dashboard” helps to easily navigate to your repositories and see useful information about them. Make sure you’re logged in to see it!\nRepositories also contain READMEs. You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it. We are using this README to communicate how to learn Git and GitHub with you. 😄 To learn more about repositories read “Creating, Cloning, and Archiving Repositories and “About README’s”.\n\n\nBranches\nYou can use branches on GitHub to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project just yet. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository—main. This makes a new working copy of your repository for you to experiment with. Once your new changes have been reviewed by a teammate, or you are satisfied with them, you can merge your changes into the default branch of your repository. To learn more about branching, read “About Branches”.\nNote: In this class, you will not be required to use branches.\n\n\nForks\nA fork is another way to copy a repository, but is usually used when you want to contribute to someone else’s project. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is very popular when contributing to open source software projects! To learn more about forking, read “Fork a repo”\nNote: In this class, you will not be required to use forks.\n\n\nPull requests\nWhen working with branches, you can use a pull request to tell others about the changes you want to make and ask for their feedback. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add more changes if need be. You can add specific people as reviewers of your pull request which shows you want their feedback on your changes! Once a pull request is ready-to-go, it can be merged into your main branch. To learn more about pull requests, read “About Pull Requests”.\nNote: In this course, you will not be required to use pull requests.\n\n\nIssues\nIssues are a way to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your work on GitHub. Issues are a great way to keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project and let others know what you plan to work on. You can also use issues to tell a favorite open source project about a bug you found or a feature you think would be great to add!\nFor larger projects, you can keep track of many issues on a project board. GitHub Projects help you organize and prioritize your work and you can read more about them in this “About Project boards document. You likely won’t need a project board for your assignments, but once you move on to even bigger projects, they’re a great way to organize your team’s work! You can also link together pull requests and issues to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request. To learn more about issues and linking them to your pull requests, read “About Issues”.\n\n\nYour user profile\nYour profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you’re interested in, the contributions you’ve made, and the conversations you’ve had. You can also give the world a unique view into who you are with your profile README. You can use your profile to let future employers know all about you! To learn more about your user profile and adding and updating your profile README, read “Managing Your Profile README”.\n\n\nUsing markdown on GitHub\nYou might have noticed already, but you can add some fun styling to your issues, pull requests, and files. “Markdown” is an easy way to style your issues, pull requests, and files with some simple syntax. This can be helpful to organize your information and make it easier for others to read. You can also drop in gifs and images to help convey your point! To learn more about using GitHub’s flavor of markdown, read “Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax”.\n\n\nEngaging with the GitHub community\nThe GitHub community is vast. There are many types of people who use GitHub in their day to day—students like you, professional developers, hobbyists working on open source projects, and explorers who are just jumping into the world of software development on their own. There are many ways you can interact with the larger GitHub community, but here are three places where you can start.\n\nStarring repositories\nIf you find a repository interesting or you want to keep track of it, star it! When you star a repository it’s also used as a signal to surface better recommendations on github.com/explore. If you’d like to get back to your starred repositories you can do so via your user profile. To learn more about starring repositories, read “Saving Repositories with Stars”.\n\n\nFollowing users\nYou can follow people on GitHub to receive notifications about their activity and discover projects in their communities. When you follow a user, their public GitHub activity will show up on your dashboard so you can see all the cool things they are working on. To learn more about following users, read “Following People”.\n\n\nBrowsing GitHub Explore\nGitHub Explore is a great place to do just that … explore :smile: You can find new projects, events, and developers to interact with.\nYou can check out the GitHub Explore website at github.com/explore. The more you intereact with GitHub the more tailored your Explore view will be."

    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis\nExploratory data analysis is the process of getting familiar with your dataset. To get started, this blog post provides a nice checklist to get you thinking:\n\n\nWhat question(s) are you trying to solve (or prove wrong)?\nWhat kind of data do you have and how do you treat different types?\nWhat’s missing from the data and how do you deal with it?\nWhere are the outliers and why should you care about them?\nHow can you add, change or remove features to get more out of your data?\n\n\n\nGenerating Questions\nGenerate at least 5 questions you might explore using this database of cookie ingredients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkimming the Data\nOne thing we often want to do during EDA is to examine the quality of the data - are there missing values? What quirks might exist in the dataset?\nThe skimr package in R, and the similar skimpy package in python (which has a much better name, in my opinion), can help provide visual summaries of the data.\nInstall both packages, and read the package documentation (R, Python).\n[Part 1] Use each package and generate summaries of your data that require the use of at least some non-default options in each package’s skim function.\n[Part 2] Write 1-2 sentences about what you can tell from each summary display you generate. Did you discover anything new about the data?\n\n\nGenerating Tables\nAnother useful technique for exploratory data analysis is to generate summary tables. You may want to use the dplyr package in R (group_by or count functions), as well as the groupby and count methods in Pandas. Python example, R example\n[Part 1] Using R and Python, generate a table that shows what proportion of recipes contain each type of ingredient, for the most common 20 ingredients.\n[Part 2] Print out a character string that lists all of the ingredients that do not appear in at least 20 recipes.\n(Delete this note, but you can include data values inline in markdown text by using backticks, at least in R. For instance, here is R’s built in value for pi: 3.1415927. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work in python using the knitr markdown engine, but you can print the list out in python anyways using a code chunk.)\n\n\nVisualization\nUsing whatever plotting system you are comfortable with in R or python, see if you can create a couple of useful exploratory data visualizations which address one of the questions you wrote above - or another question which you’ve come up with as you’ve worked on this assignment.\n[Part 1] Create at least one plot (it doesn’t have to be pretty) that showcases an interesting facet of the data.\n[Part 2] Write 2-3 sentences about what you can learn from that plot and what directions you might want to investigate from here."

I have not censored them in any way because I want you to work with data that is realistic. You should find a few test cases which you are comfortable with to use to test out your code, but you do not need to read all of the poems (and in both cases, I’ve provided you with approximately 1000 samples, so it’s probably too much to read in any case).\nHere are 5 indices (counting from 1) which are approximately G or PG in content for each poet, using the most recent snapshot CSV (20230806):\n\nSprog poems: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9\nSchnoodleDoodleDo poems: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nThese should be sufficient for you to test your code even if you are worried about being exposed to adult themes or language during this activity."

Fortunately, a camera was planted at the location where the body was found. The FBI has provided you with a list of people who entered the building last year, and what date and time they entered, in Pacific Standard Time (PST).\n\nsuspects &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unl-stat251/09-datetime/main/suspects.csv\")\n\nUnfortunately, the date and time of the murder is not known. You have been hired to crack the case. Use the clues below to discover the murderer’s identity.\n\nBased on the sunburn patterns on the body, the murder was not committed in the morning.\nThe room where the murder was committed is closed Tuesdays and Thursdays, so the murder did not happen on those days.\nIt is believed that the murder was committed within 5 weeks (35 days) of Thanksgiving, 2018.\nIt was discovered that just before being murdered, the victim tried to send a text to her sister in Iceland, saying “Goodnight over there!”\nThe Killer left behind a birthday card at the scene of the crime. The date is smudged, but the number of the day is shown to be 22. It is thought that perhaps this murder took place less than two days after the Killer’s birthday.\nThe Killer him/herself is amused by our efforts, and he has sent us a cryptic clue: “The number of minutes between Jan 1, 1970 at midnight and the time I arrived on the scene is divisible by 10.”\n\nWho is the killer?"
